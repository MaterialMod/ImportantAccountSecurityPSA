Developers,

**This is a somewhat unconventional approach, but we wanted to make you aware of a potential risk. Please take a few minutes to read the following recommendations on how to protect your accounts from the following risk.**

We discovered a few developers were impacted by a malicious behavior known as “SIM swapping.” A **SIM swap** happens when a bad actor convinces your mobile carrier to switch your phone number / mobile account to a device they control. The bad actor can then make and receive phone calls or SMS messages with that number. This also means that the bad actor can bypass certain 2-step security checks you may have in place.

For example, if a bad actor is able to intercept your phone messages, it may be possible for them to attempt to reset passwords and claim accounts associated with the compromised mobile account. In the case of your Roblox account, it could be compromised in this manner if

- **2 Step Verification is NOT turned on**
– OR –
- 2 Step Verification IS enabled, but the bad actor also has access to your email account.

**We recommend that you take the following steps to help protect your account from this risk, or the accounts of your co-developers.**

1 - To prevent anyone from gaining access to your mobile account, you should contact your mobile provider to secure your mobile number. There may be options such as:

Creating a PIN on your mobile account

Setting up a verbal passcode with their customer service representatives

Explore other measures that the customers service representatives can use to verify your identity (such as requiring in-person ID)

2 - Another way to reduce the risk of SIM swapping is to not use your personal mobile account to manage and secure sensitive accounts. Instead, **create a virtual mobile number** with a service like Google Voice. The virtual mobile number is not directly associated with the mobile device, which helps add another layer of security. For example, when you try to access an account with mobile 2-step security checks (whether it is your Roblox account, email, etc), any messages to the **virtual mobile number** will go to the application registered to the virtual number and not the device itself.

3 - We also recommend you use **unique, secure passwords** and an **email provider that implements multi-factor other advanced authentication features**. A secure email service should at least provide 2FA via an application like Google Authenticator.

Thank you.
